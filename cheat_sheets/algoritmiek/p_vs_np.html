            <p>The Computational Complexity is categorized into difficulty, called Computational Classes</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>P: problems that have a solutation that can be solved in polynomial time.</li>
                    <li>NP: problems that can be verified in polynomial time, but may take an exponential number of steps to solve. </li>
                    <li>NP complete: hardest problems in NP to complete.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Does P = NP? Are questions that are verified in polynomial time also solved in polynomial time?</p>
