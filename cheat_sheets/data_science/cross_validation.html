            <p>In cross-validation, a dataset is first split into <b>folds</b>.</p>
            <p>In each experiment run, all folds except one are used for train and the remaining fold is used for validation.</p>
            <p>The number of folds is equivalent to the numbero of folds, i.e., each fold is used once for testing.</p>
            <p>This means that the result of cross-validation is a score for each fold.</p>
            <p>Typically the mean of the score is reported along with the standard descriptive statistics about the distribution of the scores.</p>
            <p>Cross-validation generally prevents overfitting better than a single split into training and validation.</p>
            <p>However, cross-validation is computationally more expensive.</p>
            <p>There are different types of cross-validation. The main types are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>K-fold cross-validation</b> split into n folds</li>
                <li><b>Stratified K-fold Cross Validation</b> The splitting of data into folds may be governed by criteria such as ensuring that each fold has the same proportion of observations</li>
                <li><b>Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)</b> each data instance is a fold. The number of runs corresponds to the number of folds.</li>
            </ul>
