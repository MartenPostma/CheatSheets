            <p>Support Vector Machines, or SVM, are typically used for classification purposes.</p>
            <p>The goal is to predict hyperplanes that divide the training examples into separate classes.</p>
            <p>A support vector is a data point that is closest to a hyperplane.</p>
            <p>The further away a data point is to a hyperplane, the more confident we are about the prediction.</p>
            <p>The distance between a hyperplane and a support vector is called the margin.</p>
            <p>In training, the goal is to maximize the margin.</p>
            <p>If the patterns in the data are non-linear, we have to move to higher dimensions in order to find hyperplanes, which is computationally expensive.</p>
            <p>This is where the kernel trick comes in, which allows us to remain in the original feature space.</p>
